# Alien Invasion

This is an alien invader game written using pygame library. Pygame is a powerful Python modules that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for users to build sophisticated games. In this particular game, a user is given a ship at the bottom center of the screen. A ship will be able to move left, right, top, bottom and shoot bullets at the aliens who are invading the screen from top down. A scoring, level, and ship lives are displayed at the bottom of the screen for the users to keep track of their score, level and lives. The game will be over once a user loses all lives, and will be able to play a new game from the beginning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install python packages with pip/pip3

## Checking for pip on Linux and OS X
```
pip/pip3 --version
```
You should see the similar output 
```
pip 21.3.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```
If you have more than one version of Python on your system, verify that pip is associated with the version of Python you're using--for example, ```python 3.7 ``` in this case.

If you can't run the pip command, try installing pip


### Installing

## Installing pip on Linux and OS X
```sudo python get-pip.py```
